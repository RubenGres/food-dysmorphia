###  A Hungry EcoCities project 

Food Dysmorphia uses AI technology to empower citizens to critically examine the impact of the industrial food complex through aesthetics and storytelling.

It addresses the hidden economic aspects of the food system, revealing the true costs obscured within the complexities of the food industrial complex. The project maps out food inequalities, visually representing externalized costs to enhance understanding. It aims to develop a "reality filter" using AI and computer vision, altering images of fruits and vegetables to reflect their true costs, thus facilitating discussions, actions, and knowledge sharing. The target audience includes individuals interested in sustainability, food systems, and social change, especially those open to deeper exploration of these topics.

This is a political project, shedding light on the political dimensions of the food industry and its societal impact.
