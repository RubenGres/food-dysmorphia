            "\n",
            "1. Implement efficient farming techniques, such as proper land preparation, effective irrigation systems, pest control strategies, and regular pruning to increase yields and maintain healthy lemon trees. Embracing sustainable and organic practices can also help you command higher prices in the market.\n",
            "Source: https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/profitability/lemon-cultivation-profitability\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Fertilize lemon trees appropriately using a balanced fertilizer, like a 10-10-10 mix, during the growing season to provide essential nutrients. Organic fertilizers such as compost, manure, or fish emulsion can also be beneficial.\n",
            "Source: https://www.roysfarm.com/lemon-farming/\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Prolong the shelf life of lemons to enhance their profitability. While cut lemons last only 3 to 4 days even under refrigeration, whole lemons can last up to 1 week in conducive conditions and up to 3 weeks in a fridge. Farmers can invest in value addition processes to further increase profits and shelf life.\n",
